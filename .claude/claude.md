# Claude Code Instructions

## Code Style Guidelines

### Comments Policy
- **DO NOT** add explanatory comments to code unless explicitly requested by the user
- **DO NOT** add inline comments explaining what code does
- **DO** add comments only when the user explicitly asks for them, or documentation
- **DO** add comments for complex algorithms where a brief explanation adds significant value
- Keep the codebase clean and comment-free unless comments already exist or are specifically requested
- Trust that the code is self-documenting through clear naming and structure
